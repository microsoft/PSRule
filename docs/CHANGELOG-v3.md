## Unreleased

What's changed since release v2.9.0:

- General improvements:
  - **Breaking change:** Switch to use SHA-512 for generating unbound objects by @BernieWhite.
    [#1155](https://github.com/microsoft/PSRule/issues/1155)
    - Objects that have no bound name will automatically be assigned a name based on the SHA-512 hash of the object.
    - Previously a SHA-1 hash was used, however this is no longer considered secure.
    - The name for unbound objects that are suppressed will change as a result.
    - Additionally the hash can be changed by setting the `Execution.HashAlgorithm` option.
    - See [upgrade notes][1] for details.
