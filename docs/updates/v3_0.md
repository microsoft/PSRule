## Visual Studio Code

### New home and identity

The Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension for PSRule now lives side-by-side with core components of [PSRule on GitHub][1].

As part of this change we are now publishing the extension as a **verified** Microsoft extension with the ID `ps-rule.vscode-ps-rule`.

We hope this will not only help the community to log issues and get help on the correct repository,
but also streamline how we deliver updates in the future.

Bringing together the code base is the first step in building an all improved rich experience in VSCode for PSRule.

### Runtime integration

Previously to use PSRule within VSCode,
a prerequisite step was to install PowerShell on non-Windows OSs and then install PSRule through PowerShell.

We've done away with this approach entirely for the authoring experience in VSCode by providing native support in the extension.

### Other minor features and improvements

- You can now override the options file that VSCode uses when running PSRule.
  - Previously only `ps-rule.yaml` was used by VSCode although PSRule generally supported changing the options file.
