# nnn nnn (v3.0)

Welcome to the nnn nnn release of PSRule.
There are many updates in this version that we hope you'll like, some of the key highlights include:

- [Official CLI support](#official-cli-support) &mdash; A new CLI experience for PSRule.
- [Module lock file](#module-lock-file) &mdash; Manage the versions of modules used by PSRule.
- [Runtime integration](#runtime-integration) &mdash; More seamless integration with Visual Studio Code.

See the detailed change log [here](../CHANGELOG-v3.md).

## Official CLI support

While many of you have been using PSRule through PowerShell for some time,
we've been working on a new experience for those who prefer a CLI.

Additionally we wanted to improve the bootstrapping experience for PSRule in CI/CD pipelines.

The new CLI runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux and is available as a standalone executable or can be installed as a .NET tool.

## Module lock file

We've introduced a new feature to help you manage the versions of modules used by PSRule.
The module lock file is a JSON-based file named `ps-rule.lock.json` that lists the modules and versions used by PSRule.

This makes it easier to share and reproduce the versions of modules used during development and CI/CD pipelines.

## Visual Studio Code

### New home and identity

The Visual Studio Code (VSCode) extension for PSRule now lives side-by-side with core components of [PSRule on GitHub][1].

As part of this change we are now publishing the extension as a **verified** Microsoft extension with the ID `ps-rule.vscode-ps-rule`.

We hope this will not only help the community to log issues and get help on the correct repository,
but also streamline how we deliver updates in the future.

Bringing together the code base is the first step in building an all improved rich experience in VSCode for PSRule.

### Runtime integration

Previously to use PSRule within VSCode,
a prerequisite step was to install PowerShell on non-Windows OSs and then install PSRule through PowerShell.

We've done away with this approach entirely for the authoring experience in VSCode by providing native support in the extension.

This means you can now use PSRule in VSCode without needing to install PowerShell or PSRule on your machine.
We've improved the experience by adding the ability to:

- Restore modules from the VSCode command palette.
- Asking to automatically restore required modules when you open a workspace that contains a PSRule lock file.

### Other minor features and improvements

- You can now override the options file that VSCode uses when running PSRule.
  - Previously only `ps-rule.yaml` was used by VSCode although PSRule generally supported changing the options file.
