# PSRule

PSRule is an open-source, general-purpose rules engine built on top of PowerShell and maintained on GitHub.

PSRule provides an easy way to:

- Define reusable business rules like scripts
- Validate PowerShell objects with rules by piping them to PSRule

Because PSRule is based on PowerShell:

- It builds on existing PowerShell skills
- Works with other PowerShell modules and .NET classes
- Works great with source control and DevOps pipelines

## Download PSRule

You can download and install the PSRule module from the PowerShell Gallery.
